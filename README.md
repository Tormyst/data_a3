# Assignment 3: Association Rule Mining Algorithm Implementation

## Implementation by Raphael

This project was created to spec for data mining class.

## Setup
A make file has been included which provides a default command to build the program.  To create the program use this command:
```bash
make
```

## Running

The makefile creates an executable named **ass3**.  The program takes in **3** arguments.

* A Data File
* A Minimum Support Rate
* A Minimum Confidence Rate

Running this regularly requires putting this in the PATH variable, or can be run by giving the path.  In most cases the easiest form of this is to append `./` to the beinging of the path name.

```bash
./ass3 <Data File> <Minimum Suport Rate> <Minimum Confidence Rate>
```

To bring up this information, simply use the command:
```bash
./ass3 -h
```
